# This method is the main entrance to our twitter application. It takes the
# command the user wants to execute and an array containing everything else that
# was passed in.
#
# It's up to you to decide what this function returns; But I'd recommend an
# array of strings to display to the user.
#
# Examples:
#   run_app("timeline", ["zspencer"])
#   run_app("post", ["Wow!", "@CodeUnionIO", "is", "the", "greatest!"])
#   run_app("message", ["jfarmer", "Huh", "the", "more", "you", "know..."])
#
def run_app(command, arguments)
  []
