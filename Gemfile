# As programmers, we sometimes want to re-use code other people have written.
# When people write code and publish it for other programmers to use it's
# called a "library."
#
# In Ruby, we call our libraries "gems." Why? Because programmeres like to
# think we're funny. This file (called the "Gemfile") is a list of the gems
# that our program is going to use.
#
# We'll be using Bundler (http://bundler.io) to download these gems to our
# system with the following command:
#
# `bundle install`
#
# The `source` line tells Bundler to download gems from `rubygems.org`, where
# most public libraries are published.
